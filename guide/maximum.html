      <h3>Social Security Maximum</h3>

     <h1>Maximum possible Social Security benefit in {{CURRENT_YEAR}}</h1>
     <p>
       Few people will recieve the maximum possible benefit, but how high is
       the maximum? The short answer is that the maximum monthly Social Security
       benefit that an individual who files a claim in {{CURRENT_YEAR}} can
       receive is:
     </p>
     <blockquote style="font-size: 18px">
       <b>${{maximumMonthlyBenefit | number}} / month</b>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
       In order to reach this high of a benefit, someone must have:
     </p>
     <ul>
       <li>Waited until age 70 to file for benefits</li>
       <li>Earned at least the maximum taxable earnings for at least 35 years
           of their life.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>You can see what the per-year maximum taxable earnings are from the
     Social Security Adminstration's 
     <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/cbb.html">maximum taxble income table</a>.
     </p>

     <h2>Different filing ages</h2>
     <p>
       At other filing ages, the maximum possible benefit would be smaller:
     <p>
     <ul>
       <li>${{normalMaximumMonthlyBenefit | number}} / month at age 66</li>
       <li>${{earlyMaximumMonthlyBenefit | number}} / month at age 62</li>
     </ul>
     <p>
       The <a href="/">social security calculator</a> will allow you to see
       the benefit at any starting age, for any earnings record.
     </p>
     <h2>Spousal benefit</h2>
     <p>
       The spouse of someone earning the maximum monthly benefit would also be
       eligible to earn a spousal benefit on the same record of as much as half
       of the primary earner's benefit.
     </p>
     <p>
       In the case of the primary earner earning the maximum benefit of
       ${{maximumMonthlyBenefit | number}} / month, the spouse would also
       be eligible for an additional maximum benefit of 
       ${{spouseMax | number}} / month. This would take the total benefit for
       this family to ${{familyMax | number}} / month. If the spouse also had
       maxed out his or her own record, the total benefit for the two maximum
       personal benefits is simply double a single personal benefit, which is
       ${{maximumMonthlyBenefit * 2 | number}} / month.
     </p>

     <h2>Fewer working years</h2>
     <p>
       Should someone who had high taxable income work more years to increase
       their social security benefit? The answer is usually no. Benefits grow
       more slowly as they approach the maximum. For example, imagine the same
       person earned fewer than 35 years at the maximum income:
     </p>
     <ul>
       <li>30 Years: ${{max30 | number}} / month, only ${{maximumMonthlyBenefit - max30}} less</li>
       <li>25 Years: ${{max25 | number}} / month, only ${{maximumMonthlyBenefit - max25}} less</li>
     </ul>
