      <h1>Social Security International Agreements</h1>
      <p class=postdate>June 26, 2022</p>
      <p>
        SSA.tools calculates social security benefits based on a person's
        earnings record, copy/pasted from ssa.gov. In cases of work abroad, this
        record may be insufficient to estimate one's benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the late 1970's, the United States has established a network of
        bilateral Social Security agreements that coordinate the U.S. Social
        Security program with the comparable programs of other countries.
        International Social Security agreements, often called "Totalization
        agreements", help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have
        divided their careers between the United States and another country.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ssa.gov website maintains a full list of all <a
          href="https://www.ssa.gov/international/agreements_overview.html">Totalization
          Agreements</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        These agreements allow earned income credits to be earned overseas and
        still count towards the minimum of 40 credits required for benefits in
        the US. They also allow for an adjusted benefit based on the amount of
        time employed in each location.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website does not provide a way to directly enter overseas earnings
        nor to compute the related benefits. It should be used as a starting
        point, but not the final answer, in a case of a multinational career.
