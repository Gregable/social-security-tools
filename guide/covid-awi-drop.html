        Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jgatcomb/">jgatcomb</a>
        started an interesting thread about the
        <a
          href="https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k4rlv8/91_permanent_reduction_in_social_security/">
          impact
          of Covid-19 on Social Security recipients born in 1960
        </a>. In it,
        jgatcomb referred to a
        <a
          href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20200912157/a-drop-in-social-securitys-average-wage-index-could-hurt-four-million-people">
          morningstar
          article
        </a> suggesting that those born in 1960 will potentially have their
        benefits permanently reduced by 9.1%. How true is this? Let's use the
        SSA.Tools calculator to understand this better.
      </p>
      <br style="clear:both">
      <p>
        We want to simulate a earner who:
      <ul>
        <li>Has 35 years of average earnings records.</li>
        <li>Their last record will be 2020.</li>
        <li>They were born in 1960.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I've created a data file with exactly this setup. You can try it for
        yourself by copying the entire file at
        <a href="/covidpaste.txt">covidpaste.txt</a> and then pasting it in to
        the
        text box on the <a href="/calculator.html">SSA.tools Calculator</a>.
        After
        doing so, select a birthday in 1960, but not Jan 1, because with Social
        Security law, you attain an age the day before your standard birthday.
      </p>
      <p>
        The resulting earnings table will look like this:
      </p>
      <img src="/static/covid-earnings.jpg"
        style="margin: 2em auto 2em auto; display: block; border: 1px solid black">
      <p>
        From this table, Social Security will calculate your AIME or Average
        Indexed Monthly Earnings. If you have 35 vaules, it's really just the
        average of all of the values in the "Indexed Earnings" column divided by
        12 to get from annual to monthly. The calculation is a little further
        down the page:
      </p>
      <img src="/static/covid-aime.jpg"
        style="margin: 2em auto 2em auto; display: block; border: 1px solid black">
      <p>
        At this point, we can start to think about how Covid-19 might affect the
        AIME calculation for this 1960-born earner. The key is the "Multiplier"
        collumn in the earnings table. The ssa.tools calculator doesn't
        currently explain where these multipliers come from, since the user has
        no control over them, but I will attempt to do so now.
      </p>
      <p>
        These multipliers are only estimates until a person turns 62. In the
        year one turns 62, the final multipliers are calculated for all years up
        to and including age 60. All later years, the multiplier will always be
        1.0. For the years up to and including age 60, the multipler for a given
        year will be the Average Wage Index (AWI) in the year you turned 60
        divided by the AWI of the multiplier year. So, for someone who turns 60
        in year 2020:
      </p>
      <style>
        .division td {
          padding: 6px;
          text-align: center;
        }

        .division {
          margin: auto;
        }
      </style>
      <table class=division>
        <tr>
          <td rowspan=2>Multiplier (year X) =</td>
          <td style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">AWI (year 2020)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>AWI (year X)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        We can then multiply this by Taxed Earnings to see how AWI affects the
        Indexed Earnings in each year:
      </p>
      <table class=division>
        <tr>
          <td rowspan=2>Indexed Earnings (year X) =</td>
          <td style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">Taxed Earnings (year X) x
            <b>AWI (year 2020)</b>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>AWI (year X)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        We can also see why calculations are made 2-years "late". The AWI for a
        given year is not known until taxes are filed the following year. So the
        AWI for 2020 won't be known until late in 2021. By the start of 2022, we
        will know the AWI correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically multipliers only increase every year, because typically
        AWI only increases every year, but this is not guaranteed. In fact, you
        can see the 2008 multiplier is slightly lower than the 2009 multiplier
        (1.31 vs 1.33) because of the 2008 recession.
      </p>
      <p>
        How does Covid-19 factor into this? If the AWI (year 2020) is reduced by
        9.1% for example, then <u>every</u> Indexed Earnings value is also
        reduced by 9.1%. If <u>every</u> Indexed Earnings value is reduced by
        9.1%, then the AIME is also reduced by 9.1% since it is just an average
        of the top 35 years of Indexed Earnings values.
      </p>
      <p>
        The morningstar article suggest that AWI could be 9.1% less than
        expected (or 5.9% less than 2019 depending on what you are comparing it
        to). This is based on the Social Security Trustees report, so it is
        probably a good estimate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The number one really cares about is the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA),
        not AIME, since PIA is the number that benefits are based on. However,
        since the bend points in the PIA formula are also adjusted by AWI, the
        effect on PIA is also very close to the same as on AIME. The calculator
        provides no easy means for manually modifying bend points to demonstrate
        easily, but we can do so manually for this example.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, let's see what the calculator predicts as the PIA if there was
        not a covid related drop:
      </p>
      <img src="/static/covid-pia.jpg" style="margin: 2em auto 2em auto; display: block; border: 1px solid
      black">
      <p>
        Next, adjust both the AIME and the bendpoints downward by 9.1%:
      </p>
      <img src="/static/covid-pia-2.jpg" style="margin: 2em auto 2em auto; display: block; border: 1px solid
      black">
      <p>
        Going from $1,977.60 to $1,798.40 is a 9.06% drop, very similar to the
        9.1% number we started with. In conclusion, a significant drop in AWI in
        a single year can have an similarly outsized effect on the Social
        Security benefits for those who turn 60 in that year. In the history of
        the Social Security program, there has not been such a dramatic drop in
        AWI from one year to the next like Covid appears to have produced, so
        this has never been much of an issue until now.
