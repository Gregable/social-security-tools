        Social Security calculates and pays benefits <i>monthly</i>. However
        there are still several rules that are affected by the day of the month
        that you were born.
      </p>
      <div style="clear: both;"></div>
      <h2>Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        Eligibility rules have to do with what month you are first eligible to
        recieve social security benefits. There are a couple rules that interact
        with the day of the month:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Social Security is based on English Common Law which states that you
          "attain" a particular age on the day before your birthday. So, if you
          are born on May 1, you will attain age 62 on April 30.
        </li>
        <li>
          You are eligible for a benefit on the first month that you are a
          particular age through the entire month.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br style="clear:all">
      <p>
        Rule #2 interacts with rule #1. Let's illustrate with three example
        birthdays:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>May 1, 1960</b>: Attained 62 on April 30, 2022. First month
          age 62 through the entire month is <b>May</b>, 2022.</li>
        <li><b>May 2, 1960</b>: Attained 62 on May 1, 2022. First month
          age 62 through the entire month is <b>May</b>, 2022.</li>
        <li><b>May 3, 1960</b>: Attained 62 on May 2, 2022. First month
          age 62 through the entire month is <b>June</b>, 2022.</li>
      </ul>
      Some resources will tell you that the first month you can begin benefits
      is 62 + 1 month. The third example above shows where this comes from, but
      it doesn't apply if you were born on the 1st or 2nd of a month.

      <h2>Benefit Payment Date</h2>
      In most cases, the date of payment is also based on the day of the month
      you were born:
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you were born on the 1st through the 10th of the month, you’ll be
          paid on the second Wednesday of the month.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you were born on the 11th through the 20th of the month, you’ll be
          paid on the third Wednesday of the month.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you were born after the 20th of the month, you’ll be paid on the
          fourth Wednesday of the month.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are some exceptions though. If you recieve a benefit based on
        someone else's work record, such as a spousal benefit, this will be paid
        the same day as the primary beneficiary.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also certain recipients who may recieve payment on the 3rd of
        the month:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You filed for benefits before May 1, 1997
        </li>
        <li>
          You also receive a Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payment;
        </li>
        <li>
          Your Medicare premiums are paid for by the state where you live.
        </li>
        <li>
          You live in a foreign country.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And finally federal holidays or weekends bump the payment to the
        non-holiday weekday immediately preceding the scheduled date.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way to view the payment date is the <a
          href="https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10031-2023.pdf">Schedule of
          Social

        When you enter your birthdate into the <a

        are taken into account for you.
