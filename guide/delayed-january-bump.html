      <h1>Bump in delayed Social Security benefits after January</h1>
      <p class=postdate>Apr 29, 2023</p>

      <p>
        When using the ssa.tools calculator, you may have noticed a small notch
        or bump in the income chart when choosing a benefits start date later
        than the Normal Retirement Age. Here's an example of what this might
        look like for someone retiring at the age of 68 and 5 months. Initially,
        the recipient's benefit is $2,258 / mo but in the following January it
        jumps to $2,392 / mo:

      <p>If this is not a bug, what's going on?</p>

      <p>
        When someone chooses to delay collecting social security past the Normal
        Retirement Age (typically 65), they earn delayed credits that increase
        their benefit by 6.67% per year (0.56% per month) in exchange for
        waiting a little longer.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, due to a little known quirk in the way the credits work, you
        only earn credits based on the months delayed in the previous calendar
        year.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the example image above, the recipient began their benefit in
        November 2018, so intially the benefit was based only on months delayed
        in 2017.
        The additional 10 months of delayed credits were in 2018 and are not yet
        credited to the recipient. In Jan 2019, those credits kick in and the
        additional bump in benefits does as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are a few cases where this bump does not appear:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><u>Early Benefit Reductions</u>: This rule only affects credits from
          delaying after Normal Retirement age, it does not affect reductions
          from
          starting benefits early.</li>
        <li><u>Age 70</u>: If the recipient starts the benefit at age 70, even
          if that
          is in the middle of the year, the full credits are applied.</li>
        <li><u>Spousal Benefits</u>: Spousal benefits are not affected by
          delayed
          credits and so are unaffected by this rule.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This is not related to Cost of living adjustments (COLA). COLA is also
        applied in January, but in addition to this rule.
