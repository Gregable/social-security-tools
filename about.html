      <h1>About the Social Security Calculator</h1>
      <p>
        This site provides individuals with an estimate of their future Social
        Security retirement benefits. The benefits are based on the earnings
        record provided by the Social Security Administration. A detailed report
        is created from this data.
      </p>
      <h3>What If?</h3>
      <p>
        This site provides clear interactive visuals that let the user
        investigate how different choices might affect their overall benefit.
        Scenarios include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          What happens to my benefit if I earn additional wages for several
          more years?
        </li>
        <li>
          How does my benefit change as my total earnings grow during my
          lifetime?
        </li>
        <li>
          What happens if I choose to take my benefits early? What if I delay
          and take them late?
        </li>
        <li>
          How are my benefits affected by my spouse's earnings records, and
          vice versa.
        </li>

      </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
        This site does not store any data entered by users. All calculations are
        made client-side in the browser's JavaScript and are never transmitted
        over the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        While unnecessary for security, this can be confirmed by loading the
        site in your browser, and then disconnecting your computer before
        entering any additional data.
      </p>
      <h3>Accuracy</h3>
      <p>
        This site should be correct, and I will update it as Social Security
        rules change. However, there are no <i>guarantees</i> of the accuracy of
        this information. It should be treated as a useful exploratory tool, but
        any decisions should be made after researching the subject yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site was most recently updated on Jun 16, 2023.
      </p>
      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>
        This site is completely free and contains no advertising. I don't
        collect your email address, subscribe you to SMS services, make a credit
        report inquiry, kill a dolphin, etc. Feel free to use the site without
        wondering if there is a catch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Costs for running the site are minimal, just a few dollars a year, plus
        my time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I noticed that most people don't understand their Social Security
        benefits very well. The online tools at SSA.gov are excellent, but
        I felt lacking in a few places. In particular, I felt that by simply
        spitting out a final number, the results failed to educate the user as
        to how the program works. I thought it would be useful to contribute a
        tool that helped folks to understand their own Social Security benefit
        and how it will help them in the future.
