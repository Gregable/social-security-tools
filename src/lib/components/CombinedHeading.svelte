      Use two separate parageaphs to insure that this section has enough
      height that it can actually be selected in the sidebar correctly. It's

      causes weirdness with the sidebar.

      So far we have only looked at each person's personal benefits based on
      their own earnings record.

      In some cases, recipients are eligible for additional benefits based on
      their spouse's earnings record.
