            The multipliers and indexed earnings in the table below will
            increase every year until <RecipientName
              r={recipient}
              suffix=" reaches">you reach</RecipientName
            > age 60, after which point they are fixed. Years after age 60 will be
            a 1.0 multiplier. The increase in the multipliers is determined by US
            wage growth. Thus, your indexed earnings in a given year are scaled to
            be equivalent to a wage in the year you turn 60.

              For
              <RecipientName r={recipient}>you</RecipientName>, this means that
              years where the indexed earnings value falls below
              <b>{$recipient.cutoffIndexedEarnings().wholeDollars()}</b>
              do not affect the benefit calculation because they are not among the
              top 35.

            <p>
              As you don't have 35 years of earnings yet, every additional year
              you work will increase the benefit a little more. Once you reach
              35 years of earnings values, increasing the AIME requires earning
              more than previous years' indexed values.
