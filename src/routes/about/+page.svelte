    <h1>About the Social Security Calculator</h1>
    <p>
      This site provides individuals with an estimate of their future Social
      Security retirement benefits. The benefits are based on the earnings
      record provided by the Social Security Administration. A detailed report
      is created from this data.
    </p>
    <h3>What If?</h3>
    <p>
      This site provides clear interactive visuals that let the user investigate
      how different choices might affect their overall benefit. Scenarios
      include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        What happens to my benefit if I earn additional wages for several more
        years?
      </li>
      <li>
        How does my benefit change as my total earnings grow during my lifetime?
      </li>
      <li>
        What happens if I choose to take my benefits early? What if I delay and
        take them late?
      </li>
      <li>
        How are my benefits affected by my spouse's earnings records, and vice
        versa.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>
      This site does not store any data entered by users. All calculations are
      made client-side in the browser's JavaScript and are never transmitted
      over the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      While unnecessary for security, this can be confirmed by loading the site
      in your browser, and then disconnecting your computer before entering any
      additional data.
    </p>
    <h3>Accuracy</h3>
    <p>
      This site should be correct, and I will update it as Social Security rules
      change. However, there are no <i>guarantees</i> of the accuracy of this information.
      It should be treated as a useful exploratory tool, but any decisions should
      be made after researching the subject yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The site was most recently updated on Oct 12, 2023 with the latest 3.2%
      COLA adjustment.
    </p>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>
      This site is completely free and contains no advertising. I don't collect
      your email address, subscribe you to SMS services, make a credit report
      inquiry, kill a dolphin, etc. Feel free to use the site without wondering
      if there is a catch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Costs for running the site are minimal, just a few dollars a year, plus my
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I noticed that most people don't understand their Social Security benefits
      very well. The online tools at SSA.gov are excellent, but I felt lacking
      in a few places. In particular, I felt that by simply spitting out a final
      number, the results failed to educate the user as to how the program
      works. I thought it would be useful to contribute a tool that helped folks
      to understand their own Social Security benefit and how it will help them
      in the future.
