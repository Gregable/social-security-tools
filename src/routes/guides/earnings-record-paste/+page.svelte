  <h2>Data Paste</h2>
  <p>
    ssa.tools accepts a copy and pasted earnings record from the Social Security
    Administration's website. The box that you paste this into immediately
    updates after you paste data into it, no submit button press is required.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, in order to be parsed correctly, the data must be in a format the
    site understands. This site accepts pasted data from different browsers and
    operating systems. However, it's possible there are still a few formats that
    are unknown and not yet supported.

  <h2>Common Errors</h2>
  <div class="indent">
    <p>
      A few common issues that sometimes cause issues with the input include:
    </p>

    <h3>Copying data from the wrong place.</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>
        There is only one place on the <a
          href="https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/"
          target="_blank">ssa.gov</a
        > website where you can find your earnigns record. Once logged in, you should
        see a page like the following with a link to "Review your full earnings record
        now:"
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img

          height="578"
          alt="Screenshot of ssa.gov showing the link to the earnings record."

      <p>
        Alternatively, after logging in you can also go directly to <a
          href="https://secure.ssa.gov/ec2/eligibility-earnings-ui/earnings-record"
          target="_blank"
          >https://secure.ssa.gov/ec2/eligibility-earnings-ui/earnings-record</a
        >.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Copying data from your PDF Social Security Statement</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>
        The Social Security Administration also provides a PDF version of your
        earnings record. On page 2 of the PDF is a table with an abbreviated
        version of your earnings record that looks like the following:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src={StatementImage}
          width="359"
          height="516"
          alt="Screenshot of earnings record in PDF Social Security Statement."
        />
        <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        ssa.tools does accept this format as well, however it isn't as precise.
        If you notice, the first few rows are not individual years, but rather
        ranges of years. This means that the earnings for each year in the range
        are averaged together. This is not as precise as the data from the
        ssa.gov website.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>Other Formats</h2>
  <div class="indent">
    <p>
      Some people copy data from their own spreadsheets or similar records. If
      you do this, ssa.tools will accept most formats. Some things to keep in
      mind that will make this easier:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each year's record should be one line.</li>
      <li>The first column should be the year.</li>
      <li>
        The second column should be the taxed earnings for social security.
      </li>
      <li>You can leave additional columns, they will be ignored.</li>
      <li>
        Separate columns with any whitespace: tab, spaces, or multiple of each.
      </li>
      <li>Commas (,) and Dollar Signs ($) are allowed but not required.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>An example of this format is:</p>
    <pre class="spreadsheetPasteExample">
      2015 $5,000
      2014 $4,000
      2013 $3,000
      2012 $2,000
      2011 $1,000
