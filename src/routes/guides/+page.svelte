          If you've tried to access Social Security services recently, you may
          have encountered longer wait times, website outages, or difficulty
          reaching representatives. These challenges are not coincidental but
          stem from significant administrative changes implemented by the Trump
          administration in 2025.

          If you delay claiming Social Security benefits past your Normal

          impacting your initial payments.

        <p class="description">
          The Social Security Administration uses indexing factors to adjust
          past earnings for inflation. This guide delves into why SSA.tools uses
          current year indexing factors for younger individuals, rather than
          projected future factors, and the implications of this approach for
          benefit estimates.

        <p class="description">
          Social Security applies an annual earnings cap, meaning income above a
          certain threshold is not subject to Social Security taxes and does not
          count towards your benefit calculation. This guide explains how these
          earnings caps work, their historical changes, and their impact on your
          Social Security benefits.

        <p class="description">
          Inflation significantly impacts the value of your Social Security
          benefits. This guide differentiates between two key types of
          inflation—wage increases and the Consumer Price Index—and explains how
          each uniquely influences the calculation and purchasing power of your
          Social Security payments.
