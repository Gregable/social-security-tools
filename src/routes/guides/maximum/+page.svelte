    Few people will receive the maximum possible benefit, but how high is the
    maximum? The short answer is that the maximum monthly Social Security
    benefit that an individual who files a claim in 2023 can receive is:
  </p>
  <blockquote style="font-size: 18px">
    <b>$4,555 / month</b>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In order to reach this high of a benefit, someone must have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Waited until age 70 to file for benefits</li>
    <li>
      Earned at least the maximum taxable earnings for at least 35 years of
      their life.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can see what the per-year maximum taxable earnings are from the Social
    Security Adminstration's
    <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/cbb.html"
      >maximum taxble income table</a
    >.
  </p>

  <h2>Different filing ages</h2>
  <p>At other filing ages, the maximum possible benefit would be smaller:</p>
  <p />
  <ul>
    <li>$3,627 / month at age 66</li>
    <li>$2,572 / month at age 62</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The <a href="/">social security calculator</a> will allow you to see the benefit
    at any starting age, for any earnings record.
  </p>
  <h2>Spousal benefit</h2>
  <p>
    The spouse of someone earning the maximum monthly benefit would also be
    eligible to earn a spousal benefit on the same record of as much as half of
    the primary earner's benefit.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the case of the primary earner earning the maximum benefit of $4,555 /
    month, the spouse would also be eligible for an additional maximum benefit
    of $2,277 / month. This would take the total benefit for this family to
    $6,832 / month. If the spouse also had maxed out his or her own record, the
    total benefit for the two maximum personal benefits is simply double a
    single personal benefit, which is $9,110 / month.
