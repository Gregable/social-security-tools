    <h1>Maximum possible Social Security benefit in 2023</h1>
    <p class="postdate">August 8, 2023</p>
    <p>
      Few people will receive the maximum possible benefit, but how high is the
      maximum? The short answer is that the maximum monthly Social Security
      benefit that an individual who files a claim in 2023 can receive is:
    </p>
    <blockquote style="font-size: 18px">
      <b>$4,555 / month</b>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In order to reach this high of a benefit, someone must have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Waited until age 70 to file for benefits</li>
      <li>
        Earned at least the maximum taxable earnings for at least 35 years of
        their life.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can see what the per-year maximum taxable earnings are from the Social
      Security Adminstration's
      <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/cbb.html"
        >maximum taxble income table</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>Different filing ages</h2>
    <p>At other filing ages, the maximum possible benefit would be smaller:</p>
    <p />
    <ul>
      <li>$3,627 / month at age 66</li>
      <li>$2,572 / month at age 62</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <a href="/">social security calculator</a> will allow you to see the benefit
      at any starting age, for any earnings record.
    </p>
    <h2>Spousal benefit</h2>
    <p>
      The spouse of someone earning the maximum monthly benefit would also be
      eligible to earn a spousal benefit on the same record of as much as half
      of the primary earner's benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of the primary earner earning the maximum benefit of $4,555 /
      month, the spouse would also be eligible for an additional maximum benefit
      of $2,277 / month. This would take the total benefit for this family to
      $6,832 / month. If the spouse also had maxed out his or her own record,
      the total benefit for the two maximum personal benefits is simply double a
      single personal benefit, which is $9,110 / month.
