    <input type=checkbox id=q1>
    <label for=q1>Will inflation reduce the real value of my benefit?</label>
    <p>
      No. Social Security benefits are adjusted for inflation. The numbers in
      this report show the value in today's dollars. For example, if there is
      10% wage growth inflation between now and the time you collect your
      benefit, then the actual benefit (in terms of the actual number of
      dollars in your check) will be approximately 10% higher than this
      report shows.

    <input type=checkbox id=q2>
    <label for=q2>Will Social Security still exist by the time I retire?</label>
    <p>
      Very likely yes, but there will probably be some changes along the way.
      This website cannot predict future changes to the law, it can only show
      you what your benefit will be under current law.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may have heard that the Social Security program is running out of
      money. This is technically true, but only part of the story. Social
      Security is both paying out money to retirees and also collecting money
      from workers at the same time. Over its 80-year history, the program
      has collected more money than it has paid out and has about a $3 trillion
      reserve of extra funds. However, in recent years the program is paying
      out more than it is collecting, and so the fund is shrinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Current estimates are that the fund will run out in 2035. At that time,
      the program will still be collecting money, and those collections will
      cover all but 21% of the current payments. So, if nothing changes
      by 2035, the calculated benefit may be be reduced by 21%, but the
      payments will still continue. Roughly speaking, your primary insurance
      amount of
      <b>${{recipient.primaryInsuranceAmount() | number:2}}</b> would be reduced
      to:
      <b>${{recipient.primaryInsuranceAmount() * 0.79 | number:2}}</b>. This is
      the 'worst case' scenario.

      There are multiple mechanisms by which Congress could conceivably 'fix'
      the Social Security deficit, which would have less of an impact than the
      'worst case' scenario. What will ultimately happen is unknown. Some of
      the ideas that have been
      <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/solvency/provisions/index.html">
        proposed</a> include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increase the payroll tax which funds the program.</li>
      <li>Raise the ages at which benefits begin.</li>
      <li>
        Change the method by which inflation adjustments are made to a more
        slowly rising value.
      </li>
      <li>
        Change the bend points or ratios for the curve of annual indexed
        earnings.
      </li>
      <li>Reduce the number of years from which benefits are calculated.</li>
      <li>Reduce the spousal benefit.</li>
      <li>Invest a percentage of the fund in equities.</li>
    </ul>

    <input type=checkbox id=q3>
    <label for=q3>Are Social Security benefits taxed?</label>
    <p>
      It depends. The exact computation is complicated and depends on your
      overall income, but no more than 85% of your benefits are subject to
      federal income tax. Many states do not tax Social Security, but some do.

  <section class=frequent-questions>
    <input type=checkbox id=q4>
    <label for=q4>Will my benefit check be exactly this amount?</label>
    <p>
      No. There are a number of deductions that can be taken from the payment.
      These don't technically reduce your benefit, but they reduce the
      amount of your payment check. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Income tax withholding
        [<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/planners/taxwithold.html"
          target="_blank">ssa.gov</a>]
      </li>
      <li>
        Medicare (health insurance) Part B premium
        [<a
          href="https://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/paying-parts-a-and-b/pay-parts-a-and-b-premiums.html"
          target="_blank">medicare.gov</a>].
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnishments (ex: back taxes, student loans, alimony, child support).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are also some smaller factors which this calculator does not
      currently take into account fully, but may be added in the future. These
      include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Special Extra Earnings for Military Service from 1957 - 2001 [<a
          href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/military.html"
          target="_blank">ssa.gov</a>]. This can add as much as an additional
        $1,200 per year on your earnings record. For most, the effect
        is only a few additional dollars per month in benefits, but in rare
        cases this can be as high as hundreds of extra dollars.
      </li>
      <li>
        Windfall Elimination Provision [<a
          href="https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10045.pdf"
          target="_blank">ssa.gov</a>]. This provision can reduce the monthly
        benefit for those who earn a retirement or disability pension from an
        employer who didn't withhold Social Security taxes (typically a
        Government pension). The reduction can be up to half the value of the
        pension. About 3% of Social Security beneficiaries are affected.
