    <input type=checkbox id=q1>
    <label for=q1>Will inflation reduce the real value of my benefit?</label>
    <p>
      No. If you look closely at the earnings table at the very top
      of this report, you'll notice that years further in the past
      have higher multipliers on your earnings than more recent years.
      Every year, the Social Security Administration adjusts all of these
      multipliers upwards to account for wage inflation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are multiple economic measures of inflation. Some are based on
      increases in wages, some based on increase in prices of consumer goods.
      Your social security benefit will track wage growth inflation metrics
      until you first collect your benefit and will track consumer goods price
      inflation after you first collect your benefit. The important detail is
      that your benefit will constantly track some form of inflation, so should
      not be diminished by inflation as you get to the later years of
      retirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The numbers in this report are showing the value in today's dollars. For
      example, if there is 10% wage growth inflation between now and the time
      you collect your benefit, then the actual benefit will be approximately
      10% higher than this report shows.

    <input type=checkbox id=q2>
    <label for=q2>Will Social Security still exist by the time I retire?</label>
    <p>
      Very likely yes, but there will likely be some changes along the way. This
      website cannot predict future changes to the law, it only shows you what
      your benefit will be under current law.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may have heard that the Social Security program is running out of
      money. This is technically true, but only part of the story. Social
      Security is both paying out money to retirees and also collecting money
      from workers at the same time. Over it's 80-year history, the program
      has collected more money than it has paid out and has about a $3 trillion
      reserve of extra funds. However, in recent years the program is paying
      out more than it is collecting, and so the fund is shrinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Current estimates are that the fund will run out in 2037. At that time,
      the program will still be collecting money, and those collections will
      cover all but 21% of the current payments. So, if nothing at all changes
      by 2037, the numbers above will be reduced by 21% but the payments will
      still continue. Roughly speaking, your primary insurance amount of 
      <b>${{recipient.primaryInsuranceAmount() | number:2}}</b> would be reduced
      to:
      <b>${{recipient.primaryInsuranceAmount() * 0.79 | number:2}}</b>. This is
      the 'worst case' scenario.

      There are multiple mechanisms by which Congress could conceivably 'fix'
      the Social Security deficit, which would have less of an impact than the
      'worst case' scenario. What will ultimately happen is unknown. Some of
      the ideas that have been 
      <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/solvency/provisions/index.html">
        proposed</a> include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increase the payroll tax which funds the program.</li>
      <li>Raise the ages at which benefits begin.</li>
      <li>
        Change the method by which inflation adjustments are made to a more
        slowly rising value.
      </li>
      <li>
        Change the bend points or ratios for the curve of annual indexed
        earnings.
      </li>
      <li>Reduce the number of years from which benefits are calculated.</li>
      <li>Reduce the spousal benefit.</li>
      <li>Invest a percentage of the fund in equities.</li>

    <input type=checkbox id=q3>
    <label for=q3>Are Social Security benefits taxed?</label>
    <p>
      Yes, however only some of it. The exact computation is complicated and
      depends on your overall income, but up to 85% of your benefits may
      be taxed federally. Many states do not tax social security, but some do.

    <input type=checkbox id=q4>
    <label for=q4>Will my benefit check be exactly this amount?</label>
    <p>
      No, there are a number of deductions that can be taken from the payment.
      These don't technically reduce your benefit, but they may reduce the
      amount of your payment check. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Income tax withholding
        [<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/planners/taxwithold.html">ssa.gov</a>]
      </li>
      <li>
        Medicare (health insurance) Part B premium
        [<a href="https://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/paying-parts-a-and-b/pay-parts-a-and-b-premiums.html">medicare.gov</a>].
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnishments (ex: back taxes, student loans, alimony, child support).
      </li>
