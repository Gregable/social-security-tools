  <h2>Retirement Benefits Eligibility</h2>

  <p>
    You must earn 40 <a
      href="https://www.ssa.gov/planners/credits.html">credits</a> to be
    eligible for for a normal retirement benefit from your own work history. You
    can earn a <u>maximum of 4 credits each year</u>. If you have a short work
    history, you may not be eligible to receive retirement benefits from
    Social Security on your own work history. You may still be eligible to
    receive spousal benefits.

      Earnings before 1978 were reported quarterly, and you earned one credit
