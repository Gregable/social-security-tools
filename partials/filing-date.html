  <h2 id="nav-age-decision">Deciding what age to start benefits</h2>

  <p>
    As you can see, choosing a date to start your benefit is an important
    decision. The above charts display the consequences of each choice. By
    delaying, you will have to wait to receive any benefits. However when your
    benefits finally start they will be permanently increased compared to an
    earlier start date.
  </p>
  <h3>What do most Americans do?</h3>
  <p>
    According to a 2015 report by the Center for Retirement Research at
    Boston College,
    <a href="http://crr.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IB_15-8.pdf"
    target="_blank">Trends in Social Security Claiming</a>:
  </p>
  <p>The most popular age to start benefits is as early as possible: 62</p>
  <ul>
    <li>42% of men start benefits at age 62</li>
    <li>48% of women start benefits at age 62</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The next most popular age to start benefits is at Normal Retirement Age:
    65-66
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>34% of men start benefits at Normal Retirement Age</li>
    <li>27% of women start benefits at Normal Retirement Age</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The trend is towards starting benefits later in life. In the last 25 years,
    the number of people claiming benefits at 62 has been dropping.
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>16.6% fewer men claiming at 62</li>
    <li> 8.2% fewer women claiming at 62</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Reasons to start early</h3>
  <p>
    One consideration might be your health at the time of retirement - if you
    are unlikely to earn many years of Social Security benefits, you may want
    to choose to begin benefits sooner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another reason is personal necessity. For many, personal retirement savings
    are insufficient for the demands of living completely without a paycheck
    from work, and early Social Security benefits can assist with that burden.
  </p>
  <h3>Reasons to delay</h3>
  <p>
    Typically retirees have to worry more about finances the longer they live.
    Spending down savings over a longer number of years increases the chance
    of running out of money before death. Delaying Social Security benefits
    can be seen as insurance against the financial risk of living a long life.
    This is sometimes compared to an annuity and can be considered "longevity
    insurance", that is, insurance against living much longer than you
    anticipated.
  </p>
  <p>
    The value of the Survivor Benefit may also be something to consider when
    choosing initial benefit dates for each spouse, but especially
    the higher earner. Delaying benefits for the higher earning spouse can
    allow the lower earning spouse to have a permanently increased survivor
    benefit. This can be considered as a type of life insurance.
  </p>
  <h3>Optimization</h3>
  <p>
    The lifetime optimized value of different choices, that is, the claiming
    dates that provide the most money for you and your spouse over your
    lifetimes, depends on the one input that nobody can know: the date of death
    for you and your spouse. Online services exist which will help calculate
    the optimal strategy, but they all must make some assumptions about your
    expected lifespan.
  </p>
  <p>
    The best financial strategy for an individual or a couple is not always
    choosing the highest expected lifetime payments. For some, it is beneficial
    to receive payments during their early years of retirement, perhaps when
    spending needs may be higher due to personal reasons. For others, protecting
    against running out of money in anticipation of living a long healthy life
    is the primary concern.
  </p>
  <p>
    This tool does not currently provide a mathematical optimizer
    feature, but we can recommend the calculator at
    <a href="https://opensocialsecurity.com/" target=_blank
      >Open Social Security</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you enter your estimated Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) into Open
    Social Security you'll get a recommended filing strategy. This calculator
    weighs your options using average mortality tables. Alternately, you
    can enter your specific estimate for your date of death. The Open Social
    Security calculator also accounts for the "discount rate" of money, which
    takes into account the fact that a dollar you receive now is more valuable
    than a dollar received later.
