  <h2 id=nav-nra>Normal Retirement Age</h2>
  <p>
    Your primary insurance amount rounded down to the next lower whole dollar
    is <b>${{recipient.primaryInsuranceAmountFloored() | number:0}}</b> / month
    and is the benefit you will earn if you retire at your
    <u>normal retirement age</u> (NRA). Normal Retirement Age is between 65
    and 67, depending on when you were born. You may also see this
    referred to as the <u>full retirement age</u> (FRA).
  </p>

  <p>
    For those born in <b>{{birth.year}}</b>, normal retirement age is
    <b>{{recipient.normalRetirement.ageYears}} years and 
    {{recipient.normalRetirement.ageMonths}} months</b>.

    This puts your normal retirement date at
    <b>{{recipient.normalRetirementDate.monthName()}}, 
    {{recipient.normalRetirementDate.year()}}</b>.
  </p>

  <div class=insetTextBox ng-show="birth.day === 1">
    <h4>Special Rule</h4>
    <p>
      The month you reach specific ages may seem "off by one" from what
      you entered. Social Security follows English common law that finds that a
      person "attains" an age on the day before the birthday. Because you were
      born on the first of the month, this means that you attain age
      <b>{{exampleAge().age}}</b> on
      <b>{{exampleAge().month}} {{exampleAge().day}}, {{exampleAge().year}}</b>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    If you start collecting benefits at your normal retirement age, your
    benefit will be the primary insurance amount, rounded down:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>${{recipient.primaryInsuranceAmountFloored() | number}}</b> / month
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>${{recipient.primaryInsuranceAmountFloored() * 12 | number}}</b>
        / year
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    	You can begin taking benefits as early as 62 years old

    <p>
      You may find it oddly specific that the earliest you can actually
      begin benefits is at age 62 and 1 month. Benefit eligibility
      is calculated based on the first month that you are a particular age
      throughout the <u>entire</u> month. For most, this is the month
      <i>after</i> their birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the first month that you are <b>{{exampleAge().age}}</b>
      throughout the <u>entire</u> month is
      <b>{{followingMonth(exampleAge()).month}}
         {{followingMonth(exampleAge()).year}}</b>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    If you choose to take benefits earlier than normal retirement age
    (<b>{{recipient.normalRetirementDate.monthName()}} 
        {{recipient.normalRetirementDate.year()}}</b>),
    your benefit amount will be <u>permanently</u> <i>reduced</i> 
    per year you start early by:
    <ul>
      <li><b>6.67%</b> per year if starting AFTER
        <b>{{recipient.normalRetirement.ageYears - 3}} years and 
           {{recipient.normalRetirement.ageMonths}} months</b>
        (<b>
           {{recipient.dateAtYearsOld(recipient.normalRetirement.ageYears - 3).monthName()}}
          {{recipient.dateAtYearsOld(recipient.normalRetirement.ageYears - 3).year()}}
         </b>)
      </li>
      <li><b>5.00%</b> per year if starting BEFORE
        <b>{{recipient.normalRetirement.ageYears - 3}} years and 
           {{recipient.normalRetirement.ageMonths}} months</b>
        (<b>
           {{recipient.dateAtYearsOld(recipient.normalRetirement.ageYears - 3).monthName()}}
          {{recipient.dateAtYearsOld(recipient.normalRetirement.ageYears - 3).year()}}
         </b>)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p> 
  <p>
    If you choose instead to wait until later than normal retirement age to
    start your benefits,
    (<b>{{recipient.normalRetirementDate.monthName()}}
        {{recipient.normalRetirementDate.year()}}</b>),
     your amount will be <u>permanently</u> <i>increased</i> by
    <b>{{recipient.delayIncreaseRate() * 100 | number: 2}}%</b> per year that
    you delay.

    You can also see this same thing in the interactive chart below, with the
    age you choose to start taking benefits on the x-axis and the annual
    benefit amount on the y-axis. Move your mouse over the chart to watch how
    the earnings change based on the age that you first start taking benefits.

    <h4>Special Rule</h4>
    <p>
      Delayed "credits" are calculated based on the number of months earned in
      the previous calendar year.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that if you begin delayed benefits in a month other than
      January, your initial benefit will be a little smaller than the full
      delayed benefit, at first. This difference will disappear beginning in
      January of the following year, at which point your benefit will increase
      to the full benefit amount. If you wait until age 70, your delayed
      credits are applied immediately.
